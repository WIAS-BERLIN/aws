Title: Adaptive Weights Smoothing
Author: Joerg Polzehl <polzehl@wias-berlin.de>
Maintainer: Joerg Polzehl <polzehl@wias-berlin.de>
Description: The library contains R-functions implementing the
     Propagation-Separation Approach to adaptive smoothing as described
     in
     
     J. Polzehl and V. Spokoiny (2004) Propagation-Separation Approach for Local Likelihood Estimation,
     tentatively accepted in Prob. Theory and Rel. Fields
     
     and 
     
     J. Polzehl and V. Spokoiny (2004) Spatially adaptive regression estimation: Propagation-separation approach,
     WIAS-Preprint 998.
     
     
     This approach generalizes the 
     adaptive weights smoothing (AWS) procedure described in 
     Polzehl und Spokoiny (2000), Adaptive weights smoothing with 
     applications to image restoration. Journal of the Royal Statistical    
     Society, Ser. B,  62, 2, 335--354. The former functions 
     awsuni, awsbi and awstri have been removed. Functions 
     caws and cpaws replace the former functions aws and laws.
